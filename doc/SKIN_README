In order to make a skin, certain files are necessary inside the skin
directory. All of the images are expected to be found in the directory
for the specific skin which should be placed in the skin directory
inside of data. The way it works is that the game looks for certain
files ending in ".cfg" and reads the names of the images from
there. If any of the image files mentioned in a ".cfg" file is missing
or spelled incorrectly, the game will do strange things. The hard
coded required image ".cfg" files are the following:

archer.cfg
arrow.cfg
axe.cfg
death.cfg
sword.cfg
demon.cfg
fireball.cfg
generator.cfg
ghost.cfg
ghostgenbig.cfg
grunt.cfg
lobber.cfg
sorce.cfg
thief.cfg
valkyrie.cfg
warrior.cfg
whiteghost.cfg
wizard.cfg

These characters do not necessarily have to have images that
correspond to the name, but the name is still used in the character
selection screen. 

There are also some ".cfg" files that have names of songs which are
expected to be in the sounds directory. There are also other
miscellaneous ".cfg" files that are required. The non-image ".cfg"
files that are required are as follows:

atd.cfg
mapList.cfg
music.cfg

The other file type required in a skin is ".stm" which is a state 
machine file. The explanation of this file is found in 
STATE_MACHINE_README (which does not exist yet). I'm not too sure how
this works, but the ".stm" files that are present in the current skins
are:

firingghost.stm
ghost.stm
ghost2.stm
projectile.stm
